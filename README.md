# TheMovieDB-SwiftUI ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-13.0-brightgreen)

A SwiftUI example app that shows the movies from the TheMovieDB API.

## Description
Using the MVVM architecture with the Network Service, I create this project to learn more about the SwiftUI and its features, and that's why the app was build with no pods at all; **free from dependencies**. 

It also supports Dark Mode!
